# Laserdisc-vcr-IR-Data
IR remote data for Laserdisc and VCRs

Included are the remote profiles for multiple Laserdisc players and VCRs
The Pioneer controller data should work for most all Pioneer players but the buttons may need to be renamed depending on your player (ie. for my player play= open/close, vol= FF, ect.)
Some of the profiles are unknown and need to be tested to see which Player/Vcr they belong to so any help and input on that is appreciated!

All of these profiles will work on anything that can import and transmit IR data (There are a few smartphone apps that can do this as long as your phone includes an IR blaster or you can get an external accessory.)
